  - `r`
  - `w` 
  - `a` 
  - `x`

- Reading and Writing CSV Files: CSV files. Python provides a built-in `csv` module for reading and writing CSV files.
- Serialization and Deserialization: Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted. Deserialization is the process of converting the serialized data back into an object.
