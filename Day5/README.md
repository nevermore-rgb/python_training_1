## Day Five Breif (Data Structures)

## Topics coverd in session

- Linked List: A linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next element in the sequence.
- Doubly Linked List: A doubly linked list is a linked list in which each node has a reference to both the next and the previous node. This allows for more efficient traversal in both directions.
- Stack: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- Queue:A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. 
- Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, and the nodes are ordered in a specific way.
- Tree Traversal: Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure in a specific order.

- Created the main methods for all data structures
